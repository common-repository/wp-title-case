Automatically applied title case rules to WordPress titles. This plugin automatically updates Page and Post titles to follow title casing rules.

== Description ==

Automatically format titles across your website include the browser title, on posts and pages, category and tag lists as well as in feeds.

This plugin catches common title case formatting mistakes by capitalizing each work in a title. As of version 1.5, users can also select a minimum letter count to capitalize (by default two letter words and smaller are not capitalized).

For example:

* "the quick brown fox" will appear as "The Quick Brown Fox"

* "I love this plugin do you have more?" will appear as "I Love This Plugin do you Have More?"
